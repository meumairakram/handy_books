  ![enter image description here](https://img.shields.io/badge/Environment-Development-blue)

Handybooks is a MERN Stack Based application built as a personal test project as Proof of Concepts for some of my production level projects. It is based on some of the libraries with their depreciated versions, thus the usage of HandyBooks or its concepts in any kind of production app is highly discouraged.

You can read the HandyBooks code for your own knowledge incase you are familiar with the depreciated functions of the following libraries, in their latest versions:

 - Redux 
 - react-redux
 - react-router-dom
